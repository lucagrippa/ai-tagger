# AI Tagger
AI Tagger is an Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) plugin that simplifies tagging by using OpenAI's advance Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze and tag your document with one click! 

The plugin analyzes the current document that you have open in the editor and all of the previous tags that you have used. AI tagger will return up to 5 relevant tags that you have previously used and will generate up to 3 completely new tags.

## How to use

### Supported LLM Providers
**OpenAI**
- `GPT-3.5-Turbo`
- `GPT-4`

- `Claude 3 Opus`
- `Claude 3 Sonnet`

### Setting up the AI Tagger
- Enter your LLM provider API key in the settings tab. 
- Pick the model (LLM) that you would like to use

### One click tagging

### More precise tagging
- another way to call the AI Tagger is from the Command palette (`Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P` on macOS).
- using the Command palette navigate to the "Generate tags" command to tag your current document.
- to tag a specific part of your document highlight the text before using the Command palette.
